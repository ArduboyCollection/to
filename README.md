## Story
You are the developer of the door with the teleport function. But just before completion, someone is trying to destroy the door. There seems to be no choice but to distort the space with the power of the door and to prevent destruction.

## How to play
Let's avoid the enemy's attack by moving the door and Aim for high scores.

- **Avoid**: By continuing to avoid attack by pressing the direction key the score will be added.
- **Hide**: You can avoid attack by distorting the space. However, since the score is not added during that time, we do not recommend for a long time activation. Moreover, the energy of the door is consumed during activation, so be careful as it will not be able to distort the space when the energy runs out.
- **Jump**: If you jump the door or continue avoiding attacks continuously, the score magnification will be added.

## Controls
 + **Directional buttons**: Move the door to the left and right
 + **Button A**: Jump the door / Confirm
 + **Button B**: Distort the space / Cancel
 + **A+B+Left (only in level)**: Return to title
